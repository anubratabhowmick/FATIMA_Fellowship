Deep Learning Vision<br />
Upside down detector: Train a model to detect if images are upside down
<br />
1. Pick an image dataset (you can pick any dataset that you're comfortable with)<br />
2. Synthetically turn some of images upside down<br />
3. Build a neural network (using Tensorflow, PyTorch, or any framework you like)<br />
4. Train it to classify image orientation until a reasonable accuracy is reached<br />
5. Look at some of the images that were classified incorrectly<br />
6. Answer the following question: what is 1 idea that you have to improve your model's performance on this dataset (you don't have to implement it)<br />
