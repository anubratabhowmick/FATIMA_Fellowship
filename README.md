1. Deep Learning Vision
Upside down detector: Train a model to detect if images are upside down
<br />
Pick an image dataset (you can pick any dataset that you're comfortable with)<br />
Synthetically turn some of images upside down<br />
Build a neural network (using Tensorflow, PyTorch, or any framework you like)<br />
Train it to classify image orientation until a reasonable accuracy is reached<br />
Look at some of the images that were classified incorrectly<br />
Answer the following question: what is 1 idea that you have to improve your model's performance on this dataset (you don't have to implement it)<br />
